# FIR_FILTER
This project is a digital FIR filter coded in a FPGA. 

The importance of electronic filters is due to their great diversity of applications, such as
For example, audio equalizers, signal noise cancellation, audio processing,
biomedical signals, voice, images, telecommunications, digital audio, seismic engineering, among
others.
Digital filters, in general, are implemented in digital signal processors (DSP)
due to its defined architecture and its already established software support. However, un
FPGA also has great advantages when faced with the need to process digital signals since
allows the implementation of systems as complex as microprocessors or systems in
a single integrated circuit plus the development cost is relatively low. So
The same makes use of specialized software such as Quartus from Altera or ISE from Xilinx. The
FPGAs are replacing gate arrays and some ASICs due to their advantages
and great potential for technological development, in addition, it gives the possibility of integrating digital parts
and analog; on the other hand, they have higher operating frequencies than DSPs and
they can be easily reprogrammed.
Due to its great current demand, the study and understanding of the
FPGA operation. Therefore, the present work aims to carry out the
Implementation of a digital Gaussian filter in an FPGA device to reduce the width of
band of digital pulses to be transmitted in a communication channel with wide
band limited. This requires the theoretical design of the filter, the modular description of the
circuit, code synthesis and FPGA programming. Finally, the correct one is verified
system operation by interacting with the development board, entering
Values representing pulse, step, and sinusoid signals.
